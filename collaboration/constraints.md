# ⚠️ Project Constraints

Welcome to the boundaries that guide and shape our project 🚀  
These help us stay focused, organized, and collaborative as a team 🧠💪

## 🌍 External Constraints

These are outside our control but affect our work:

- ⏰ We must meet all **project deadlines** set by the CDSP program.
- 💻 We're required to use **GitHub** for team collaboration and version control.
- 📝 We need to provide **clear documentation** and follow **review checklists**.
- 🌐 Our work depends on stable **internet connectivity**.
- 📅 All tasks must be completed within the **official timeline** of the program.

## 🧩 Internal Constraints – Involuntary

These are challenges from within the team that we can't fully control:

- 🧑‍💻 Varying **skill levels** in programming and Git/GitHub usage.
- 🕰️ Limited **working hours** due to personal or professional commitments.
- 🌎 **Different time zones** can make real-time collaboration harder.
- 👶 Some teammates have families, so flexibility is important.

## ✨ Internal Constraints – Voluntary

These are rules we choose to follow as a team to stay productive and aligned:

- 🧼 We will follow **PEP8** coding style for Python to keep our code clean.
- 🌱 Each **branch** should implement only one focused change or feature.
- 📤 Every change must go through a **Pull Request (PR)** and be reviewed.
- 🗂️ We will keep our **project board updated** to show progress and responsibilities.
- 🧹 Avoid large PRs to make the **review process smoother**.
- 💬 We will communicate regularly and respectfully on **Slack**.
- 🤝 Everyone agrees to support and review each other's work for quality.

# Collaboration

We’re **The Hypatia Circle**, a team of five women from diverse ages, backgrounds,
and cultures, united by a shared understanding and a deep passion for utilizing
computer science to create an environment where we can all belong and thrive
together. We value creativity, openness to new perspectives, cooperation, and
having fun during the process!

We’re _**five**_, but we act as _**one**_, and here’s what we’ve agreed upon:

## _Respect and Support:_

* Respect is demonstrated through active listening, thoughtful responses,
and providing everyone with the space to speak without interruption.
* Punctuality is crucial for both meetings and deadlines. For meetings,
1-5 minutes late is okay! For deadlines, meeting deadlines is a must to show
respect for other members and accountability, while ensuring that everything is
going smoothly.
* _**All for one and one for all!**_ We’ll always be on Slack to support one
another. Make sure to communicate through the Slack channel for support.

## _Readiness:_

* Make sure to be prepared for meetings; everything related to meetings can be
found in [**MIT G21**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qp15n5iF_7j8pD_ZlR-c3YhKhV635ZLOpJf8jG7zVAk/edit?gid=0)
* Stay on track with the _**Name List-tracker**_ to know when it's your turn to
be in charge of managing meeting agendas and minutes.
* To hold a meeting, at least _**three**_ team members need to be available.
* All deadlines will be set according to the [**Syllabus**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaoVVqJD5EqmBGLw6_qzph8EZnuL6uhY/edit);
make sure to have a look at it every now and then.

## _Accountability:_

* All team members are to do their best to complete their assigned tasks by the
deadlines. If you’re faced with _**major**_ setbacks (personal or technical),
please reach out on Slack at least 2-3 days prior to the deadline.
* If you’re stuck on a technical level, spend at least _**1 hour**_ working on
the issue on your own. If you’re still stuck afterwards, then please do reach out!
* _**Mistakes happen, and it’s totally fine!**_ We’re all here for one another.
If a mistake happens, you need to own it, try to fix it, and keep the team
updated! If you need support of any kind, please reach out on Slack.

## _Conflict Resolution:_

* Everything is debatable and open for discussion; make sure to have a clear
flow of thoughts so that the team gets on board with you.
* If we reach a closed tunnel regarding any topic, we'll hold a vote on the
topic at hand and proceed with the option that receives the majority support.
* _**Tone matters a lot!**_ Make sure to be aware of your tone when delivering
thoughts and ideas.

## _Creativity and Openness to New Perspectives:_

* Feel free to get creative; if you have an idea that seems a little out of the
box, don’t hold back! Share it with the team, you never know, it might spark
something great.
* We’re open to new perspectives on _**all levels**_; personal, professional,
cultural, academic, and technical. If there’s anything that you think would
develop the team in any way, then please do not hesitate to share.
* We’re here to deliver success while having fun during the process!

## _Just for fun:_

_**Now welcome aboard The Hypatia Circle**_ Write your name and a fun fact about
yourself to help us get a better understanding of you!

* _**Alaa**_ - In the past, I never liked CS or anything related to it,
now look at me lol!
* _**Rouaa**_ – I enjoy playing with my kids maybe even more than they do,
especially puzzles 🧩 and active games 🤸‍♀️!
* _**Aseel**_ - I’m that friend who gets way too excited about organizing
things — color-coded to-do lists are my guilty pleasure.
* _**Geehan**_ - I’m juggling life, work, learning, and family — sometimes it’s
a circus, sometimes a dance party. Either way, I’m owning the chaos like a pro! 🕺💪

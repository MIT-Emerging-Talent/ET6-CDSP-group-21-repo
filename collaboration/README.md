# Collaboration

We’re **(Group name)**, a team of five women from different ages,
backgrounds, and cultures. We’re united by a shared understanding
and a deep passion for using computer science to create a space
where we all belong and thrive.

We value creativity, openness to new perspectives, cooperation,
and having fun during the process!

We’re _**five**_, but we act as _**one**_. Here’s what we’ve agreed upon:

## _Respect and Support_

* Respect is shown by active listening, thoughtful responses,
  and giving space for everyone to speak without interruption.
* Punctuality is key for both meetings and deadlines.
  Being 1–5 minutes late to a meeting is okay, but
  deadlines must be met to show respect and accountability.
* _**All for one and one for all!**_  
  We’ll always be on Slack to support each other.  
  Please communicate through the Slack channel for help.

## _Readiness_

* Come prepared for meetings.

* Use the _**Name List-tracker**_ to know when it’s your turn
  to manage meeting agendas and notes.
* To hold a meeting, at least _**three**_ members need to be available.
* Deadlines are based on the
  [**Syllabus**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TaoVVqJD5EqmBGLw6_qzph8EZnuL6uhY/edit?tab=t.0).
  Check it regularly.

## _Accountability_

* Everyone should do their best to complete tasks by the deadline.  
  If you're facing _**major**_ issues (personal or technical),
  please post on Slack at least 2–3 days in advance.
* If you’re stuck on a technical issue, spend at least _**1 hour**_
  trying on your own. If still stuck, reach out!
* _**Mistakes happen, and that’s okay!**_  
  Own them, try to fix them, and keep the team updated.  
  If you need help, just ask on Slack.

## _Conflict Resolution_

* Everything is open for discussion.  
  Be clear when sharing your thoughts to help others get on board.
* If we reach a dead end, we’ll vote.  
  The majority decision will lead the way.
* _**Tone matters!**_  
  Be mindful of your tone when sharing ideas and feedback.

## _Creativity and Openness to New Perspectives_

* Be creative! If you have an idea that’s out of the box, share it.  
  It might spark something great.
* We welcome new perspectives—personal, cultural, academic,
  or technical.  
  If something can help the team grow, speak up!
* We’re here to succeed, and have fun doing it!

## _Just for fun_

_**Now welcome aboard (Group name)!**_  
Write your name and a fun fact about yourself!

* _**Alaa**_ – I used to dislike CS, now I’m all in—look at me lol!
* _**Rouaa**_ – I love playing with my kids—especially puzzles 🧩
  and active games 🤸‍♀️!
* _**Aseel**_ – I’m that friend who gets way too excited about
  organizing—color-coded to-do lists are my thing!
* _**Geehan**_ – I juggle life, work, learning, and family.  
  Sometimes it’s a circus, sometimes a dance party.  
  Either way, I own the chaos like a pro! 🕺💪

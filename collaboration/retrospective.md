# Retrospective

Hi there, consider this our ***lashing out*** file, though in a good way.
Members of the team will reflect on their challenges, ***aha*** moments,
type out their frustrations, celebrate incremental wins, etc, etc, all in this
beautiful file. And I will kick things off!

## Stop Doing

## Continue Doing

***By Justina*** - It's being a smooth first week getting to know my teammates, planning
project strategy and mapping out our group norms. The communication via our slack
channel has been great and I have made significant contributions. I should definitely
keep this energy up!

So Far the team has followed good GITHUB collaboration practices - working via branches,
creating PR and issues, and utilizing the project board to maintain workflow. No
git conflicts yet which is awesome, keeping my fingers crossed that it remains
this way.

## Start Doing

***By Justina*** - Now is a good time for the team to start following these
steps below to minimize git conflicts:

* In your IDE, always switch to the main branch (git checkout main) and do a
git pull to get the updated version of main

* If already working on an existing branch, checkout to it, then merge the updated
main into it via git merge. if no existing branch, go on and create a branch for
the feature you want to work on.

* Before you push your branch, always repeat steps 1&2 just to ensure you are
working on the latest version of main

* As much as possible avoid using the generic "." which often translates to "all".
For example, if you do something like "format .", you may end up formatting all the
files in the repository which would cause conflicts if the actual owners of such
files makes or have made changes to same lines.

* As much as possible, work on only one file or feature per each branch you create

* When your branch has been merged and no longer needed, endeavor to delete it
to keep things clean.

* Always update the project board appropriately and review available pull requests

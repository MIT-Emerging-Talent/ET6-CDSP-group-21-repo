# Milestone 5 – Final Presentation Retrospective

## Group Retrospective

As a team, we feel proud of how far our project has come — from an idea into a clear research contribution with a strong communication strategy. Preparing the final presentation pushed us to distill months of research into a concise and engaging story. This was not easy, especially balancing technical depth with accessibility, but it helped us grow as communicators.

### The good

- Strong teamwork and support despite different circumstances.
- Clear progress turning research into a concise presentation.
- Everyone contributed in their own way (slides, script, feedback, outreach).

### The challenges

- Limited time for rehearsals.
- Stress in dividing tasks like scriptwriting and design.
- Uneven availability of team members due to personal commitments.

### Lessons learned

- Effective communication is as critical as technical results.
- Flexibility and trust keep the team moving forward.
- Feedback and iteration improve clarity and confidence.

## Individual Reflections

| Owner   | Reflection |
|---------|------------|
| **Rouaa** | I didn’t contribute much this time because of personal circumstances, but I was following along and supporting the work. I’m really happy with our progress and how the team keeps improving. It makes me excited and motivated for what’s coming next. |
| **Geehan** | For this milestone, I did not contribute as heavily to the project due to other commitments. However, I stayed engaged with the process, followed along with my teammates’ progress, and provided support when I could. Watching the presentation come together reminded me how much effort goes into communicating research clearly, not just doing the technical work. Even though my role this time was smaller, I still learned a lot by observing how the team shaped our research into a concise story. It showed me the importance of communication skills in data science, and I appreciated how supportive and flexible our group has been with each other. This milestone reinforced that being part of a team is not only about individual output, but also about encouragement, accountability, and learning together. |
| **Aseel** | It's truly amazing to see how our project has grown from a concept into a tangible solution we're so proud of. I really enjoyed working with such an amazing team. It was kinda challenging doing a script and choosing a template and what to have on slides but here we are almost done, not believing it. |
| **Justina** | Another awesome milestone that forced me to think about the process of compartmentalizing research outcomes for presentation to both technical and non-technical audience. Gained a lot of experience putting a presentation draft together and getting feedback. |
| **Alaa** | Cutie little potato, connecting the pieces and trying to reflect our technical work through a non-technical perspective was an enriching experience! Working on the content and flow of thoughts for the slides of the final presentation was interesting and fun! |
| **Majd** | I really enjoyed working on this part, even though I'm not a designer or an artistic person who usually handles presentations. Contributing to this milestone helped strengthen my non-technical skills and observational abilities. I've continued sharing updates about our project on LinkedIn and social media to raise awareness around fake job postings that often target fresh graduates and job seekers. I'll also follow up soon by reaching out to university contacts about potential partnership opportunities. |

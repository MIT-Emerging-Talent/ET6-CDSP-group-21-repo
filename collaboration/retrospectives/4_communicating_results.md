# Individual Milestone 4 Experiences : Communication Result

***Voices of Milestone 4: Personal Journeys, Shared Discoveries***

This milestone became a beautiful reminder of how much we thrive when balancing
technical work with creative expression. As a team, we stepped away from code and
 into storytelling‚Äîwhether through podcasts, comics, or visual designs‚Äîand
 discovered new strengths in the process.

Many of us felt the joy (and occasional chaos!) of creating in unconventional
spaces (hello, bathroom recordings üéôÔ∏è‚ú®). We embraced the messiness of first
attempts‚Äîwriting scripts, designing presentations, or sharing personal stories‚Äî
and found growth in those challenges. The shared laughter over audio hurdles and
 the pride in polished edits bonded us beyond just deliverables.

***What stood out was*** how deeply we reflected. Without the usual rush of
coding sprints, we had space to ask: ***Why does this matter?***
***Who are we really speaking to?***
 That shift in perspective‚Äîfrom building to communicating‚Äîhelped us connect
  more authentically with our research and each other.

And oh, the ***brainstorming sessions***! The energy of tossing ideas around,
building on each other‚Äôs thoughts, and cheering for small wins (like drafting
that perfect email ) made this milestone feel uniquely collaborative. Even our
 vulnerabilities‚Äîlike presenting to the program team or sharing scam experiences‚Äî
 became moments of collective courage.

At its heart, Milestone 4 wasn‚Äôt just about outputs; it was about us‚Äîhow we adapt,
create, and see our work through human eyes. We‚Äôre walking away not just with
skills in Canva or podcasting, but with the quiet confidence that comes from
trying something new together.

Here‚Äôs to more moments that push our comfort zones and remind us why we‚Äôre a team
 üíõ.

## Individual Retrospectives: Personal Growth Stories

### Rouaa Hamza

During Milestone 4, I struggled to record my podcast voice with my kids at home,
 so I ended up recording in the bathroom for better audio üòÖ. I also spent
 a lot of time editing the comic story, but all these challenges made me more
  skilled and adaptable üòÑ.

### Geehan Ali

This milestone gave me the rare opportunity to step back and truly reflect -
not just on our findings, but on how we got there. The breathing room from coding
 lets me think more deeply about our process and its meaning in ways I normally
  don't get to during more technical sprints.

#### Aseel Omar

I kinda enjoyed our brainstorming this milestone, everyone is sharing ideas and
working hard to deliver the best results
Im kinda gaining alot of experience on everything, it was my first time writing
a script which i really enjoyed

### Majd Abualsoud

I really enjoyed this part of the research because it was beneficial for me as
well. I shared my personal experience on avoiding scam jobs on LinkedIn, which
 will also contribute to the research‚Äîhow fun!
Another highlight was recording the podcast. It was a great milestone for me, as
 I got to present updates to the entire program team. Even though it was just a
  minute and thirty seconds long, it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and I‚Äôd
  love to keep improving my communication skills.
Oh, and I even drafted a formal email to connect with the university‚Äîanother
 small but meaningful step!

### Justina

It was refreshing to step away from codes for a while to explore the creative
sides of communicating research findings. I got to practice how to use Canva to
put together visual presentations. It was a great milestone.

### Alaa Mohammed

This milestone was all about connecting the dots together, thinking about what
 we want to deliver, how to deliver it, and to whom.

It kinda felt more of a personal milestone, delivering our work and what it means
 to us to others, hence there was a lot of brainstorming and going back and forth.

Overall, I enjoyed this milestone and I got to practice the process of thinking
 through the lens/mindset of the personas we‚Äôre actually trying to target.

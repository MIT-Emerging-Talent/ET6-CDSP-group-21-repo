# Milestone 2 Data Collection & Preparation

## 🔁 Retrospective

### ❌ Stop Doing

- Stressing too much about “perfect” datasets before even starting.  
- Relying too much on one person for data cleaning.  
- Jumping ahead to modeling before preparing clean data.

#### ✅ Continue Doing

- Helping each other understand new tools like Pandas and notebooks.  
- Sharing resources, examples, and good practices during work sessions.  
- Using the daily plan to stay aligned and focused.

#### 🟢 Start Doing

- Writing more documentation while working, not only at the end.  
- Testing scripts more often to catch errors early.  
- Saving backups of cleaned data at every stage.

---

### 📚 Lessons Learned

- Cleaning data is not just about code — it’s also about making decisions.  
- Collaboration made it easier to spot mistakes and improve quality.  
- Having one central folder for datasets helped with structure and clarity.  
- Asking questions early prevented misunderstandings.

### 🎯 Strategy vs. Board

#### ✅ What parts of your plan went as expected?

- We successfully split tasks between team members.  
- Data was collected and saved in the `/1_datasets` folder.  
- Justina helped walk everyone through the cleaning steps.

#### ⚠️ What parts of your plan did not work out?

- Some formatting and validation steps took longer than expected.  
- Confusion at first around naming conventions and file structure.

#### ➕ Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Yes — we added more explanations in the dataset README.  
- We created mini calls to clarify data-related doubts.

#### ➖ Or remove extra steps?

- We removed one duplicate dataset and re-focused on our final selection.

### 🧍 Individual Retrospectives

#### ✅ Rouaa

I learned how to collect and clean data using tools like Pandas.  
Working with the team was a great experience, and the daily plan helped me stay
organized and focused. I also started to understand how fake and real job posts
are created, and how AI can be used to make fake ones sound very realistic —  
which makes it hard to tell them apart.  
Special thanks to Justina, who helped us understand the process of data cleaning
and preparation. Her guidance made things much clearer for me.

This milestone went much better than the last one - our team really came
together. Talking through ideas felt easy and comfortable. And Justina's
guidance during this milestone was particularly invaluable. I'm so thankful for
how everyone helped and supported each other.  
I also learned how to find the right data, not just lots of data.  
At first, changing topics worried me, but now I'm excited for the challenge.  
The best part is knowing we're all improving together.

Never thought I would enjoy data collection, but I really did!  
This milestone was fun but yeah, stressful.  
I’m really proud of what we accomplished together. We honestly did amazing.

#### ✅ Justina

This was a trying milestone. Lots of long hours spent on data cleaning.  
Then even more challenges trying to fix linting errors.  
Wouldn’t it be great if there was a software that pulls all the data one
 needs, cleans it based on one’s use case, pushes it to GitHub and takes care
of all those formatting errors — while one sips juice at the beach? 🤣  
Gearing up for the next milestone! We’ve made so much progress and I’m proud  
of the team!

#### ✅ Alaa

I feel like I learned A LOT in this milestone — researching data, understanding
raw data, the process of cleaning and preparing data, to actually using it.  
Shout out to Justina for walking us through the data cleaning process!!!!

Practicing what you have learned in courses is really meaningful and valuable.  
I found Milestone 2 much better than the last two milestones.  
I got more engaged with my team, and our communication skills have improved.  
I worked on the Google Form and Data Exploration. I learned something new.

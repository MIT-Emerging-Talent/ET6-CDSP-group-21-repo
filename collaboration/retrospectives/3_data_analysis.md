# 📌 Milestone 3 – Retrospective

## 🧠 Group Retrospective

### 🔴 Stop Doing

- Trying to push forward with the platform while the data was still messy
- — it slowed us down.  
- Assuming datasets were ready to use without fully inspecting them first.  
- Making changes directly to GitHub without opening a PR first.  

### 🟢 Continue Doing

- Communicating regularly when stuck — it helped us solve issues faster.  
- Dividing tasks clearly and checking in often.  
- Supporting each other when motivation dropped.  
- Helping one another understand unfamiliar techniques (e.g. Alaa made video
- tutorials explaining "refinement").  

### 🟡 Start Doing

- Prioritizing data inspection and cleaning earlier in the process.  
- Keeping a log of challenges and how we solved them for future reference.  
- Setting mini-deadlines for large tasks like data cleaning to avoid burnout.  

### 🎓 Lessons Learned

- Data preparation takes more time than expected — it’s a full task on its own.
- Coding can feel endless, but refining messy datasets is key before jumping
- into analysis.  
- Once cleaned, the data gave us meaningful insights — the struggle paid off.  
- Internal disagreements (e.g. whether or not to drop certain dataset columns)
 must be addressed early with team-wide agreement.

## 👤 Individual Retrospectives

### **Rouaa**

For this stone, I worked on analyzing urgency tone using sentiment polarity.
I cleaned and merged the datasets, applied TextBlob to extract polarity scores,
and visualized the results.
I faced some formatting issues with ruff, especially import errors since I was
working on VS Code. I had to fix those manually before submitting my PR.
This helped me learn how to use ruff, apply sentiment analysis, and keep code
clean. Alaa also supported me in solving some tricky errors, which I really appreciated.

### **Geehan**

So far, this milestone has taken the most time,  
focus, and research from me.  
With each milestone, I feel like we’re diving deeper and deeper,  
but in this particular one,  
I truly feel the progress I’ve made  
and the awareness I’ve gained about the field  
and what we’re actually doing.  
I didn’t feel as lost during this milestone compared to the previous one.  
From a technical perspective,  
I’ve developed a really good relationship with GitHub,  
learned a lot using Google Colab,  
and I’m genuinely proud of the effort I put into this milestone  
and everything I’ve learned from it.


### **Aseel**

This milestone was honestly the toughest so far. We shifted our focus from the
platform to analyzing our datasets, and the data cleaning process took way more
time and effort than expected.  
It was days of coding and fixing issues just to get clean data. After that,
the analysis part started — still a bit challenging, but definitely more rewarding.
Overall, I learned a lot from this phase.

### **Alaa**

I gained work experience from these milestones, both in soft and technical skills.
From data exploration and initial analysis to full data analysis, I delved into
 TF-IDF.
I faced some installation errors on GitHub, but I was able to fix them quickly.
I also created charts and performed analysis using Excel.  
However, I understand the importance of Python and am familiar with using
libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib (plt), NumPy, and others.

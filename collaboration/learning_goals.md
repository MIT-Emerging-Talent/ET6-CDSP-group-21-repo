# Our Group Learning Goals

As a capable and committed team working on our group project, we aim to grow
together — not just as individuals, but as collaborators. These are the
learning goals we’ve set for ourselves as we prepare to build a meaningful and
impactful project:

## 1. Improve Team Collaboration

- Communicate clearly, respectfully, and consistently  
- Support each other through feedback, code reviews, and shared learning  
- Stay organized and aligned on goals, responsibilities, and progress  

## 2. Build the Skills Our Project Will Need

- Strengthen our technical foundation in Python, data manipulation, and
  statistics  
- Stay open to learning new tools or libraries based on the needs of the
  project  
- Focus on writing clear, modular code that can adapt as our project evolves  
- Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub to avoid conflicts and keep our
  codebase organized  

## 3. Work in a Flexible and Reflective Way

- Break our work into small, manageable steps and focus on steady progress  
- Meet regularly to share updates, give feedback, and adjust plans if needed  
- Learn from challenges as we go, rather than waiting until the end  
- Stay open to new ideas and changes, even if the original plan shifts  

## 4. Focus on Meaningful Impact

- Keep real-world problems and ethical thinking at the center of our work  
- Build solutions that are reliable, interpretable, and useful  
- Prioritize clarity, quality, and thoughtful outcomes in everything we create  

## 5. Grow Together

- Encourage everyone to take initiative and share ideas  
- Share helpful resources, tools, and learning opportunities  
- Build a team culture based on respect, growth, and mutual support

### Milestone 0: Cross-Cultural Collaboration

- [ ] Understand the fundamentals of effective cross-cultural communication in
      team-based data science projects.
- [ ] Learn and apply strategies for inclusive collaboration and decision-making
      across diverse cultural perspectives.
- [ ] Set up and manage a collaborative development environment
      (e.g., GitHub repo) using best practices in version control and documentation.

### Milestone 1: Problem Identification

- [ ] Learn how to frame a data science research question using the FRESCO framework
      (Feasible, Relevant, Ethical, Specific, Complex, Original).
- [ ] Understand how to conduct a preliminary domain study
     (e.g., remote work and job scams).
- [ ] Develop skills to critically assess project feasibility given data availability, team skills, and timeline.

### Milestone 2: Data Collection

- [ ] Learn to identify reliable data sources and assess their
      quality for research purposes.
- [ ] Gain proficiency in data cleaning techniques using tools like
      Pandas, OpenRefine, or SQL.
- [ ] Learn how to design a well-documented dataset
      (including metadata, provenance, and ethics).
- [ ] Understand the ethics of data collection and usage, especially with
      sensitive job or fraud data.

### Milestone 3: Data Analysis

- [ ] Learn how to explore datasets using EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis),
      visualizations, and summary statistics.
- [ ] Develop foundational skills in applying machine learning models for
      classification tasks (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, SVMs).
- [ ] Understand how to evaluate models using metrics like precision,
      recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- [ ] Learn how to interpret ML model outputs in a way that aligns
       with real-world decision-making.

### Milestone 4: Communicating Results

- [ ] Learn how to synthesize and simplify technical findings for different audiences
      (e.g., HR teams, job seekers, non-technical stakeholders).
- [ ] Gain skills in data storytelling using visual tools
      like Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlet.
- [ ] Develop an ethical and strategic communication plan that considers societal
      impact and possible misinterpretations of the model.

### Milestone 5: Final Presentation

- [ ] Practice and refine public speaking and pitching skills tailored to
      technical and non-technical audiences.
- [ ] Reflect on the full lifecycle of a data science project and articulate
      the lessons learned, technical takeaways, and real-world implications.
- [ ] Publish my writings on Medium and LinkedIn.
- [ ] Learn how to frame your project as a potential launchpad — whether for
      a deeper research initiative, social impact solution, or future collaboration.

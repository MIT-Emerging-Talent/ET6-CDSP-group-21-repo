## 🆘 Asking for Help

Getting stuck is part of the journey. Here's our guide for solving problems:

1. **0–30 minutes** → Try solving it yourself. Use VSCode tools, research, docs.
2. **30–60 minutes** → Ask the team on Slack or open a GitHub issue.  
3. **60+ minutes** → Tag a coach or mentor for deeper support. 💡

Be kind when asking for help, and generous when someone else needs you! 🤝

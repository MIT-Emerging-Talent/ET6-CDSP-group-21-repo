## 🎤 Opening - ***Aseel (40 sec)***  

"Hey... can I share something that happened to me?
I saw this job ad that said 'no experience required, $5,000/week, work from home'.
It sounded awesome.
But then the email came from... hiring123@gmail. That's when I knew something was
 wrong.
I'm Aseel, and you're listening to Scam Alert: Job Hunting in the Age of AI,

## 🔍 Investigation - ***Justina (1 min 10 sec)***

"Scammers have always existed — but now, they've got AI on their side.
We're talking about job posts written by ChatGPT. Posts that sound real. Look real.
Even feel professional.But they're not.
As students — especially new grads — we're vulnerable..."

## 📊 Analysis Findings

***Alaa → Geehan (1 min 40 sec)***

### Alaa's Analysis
>
> "We analyzed hundreds of job ads — real, fake, and AI-refined ones.  
> We looked at everything: word counts, punctuation, spammy phrases, and
repetitive language.  
> Want to hear something weird? AI-generated posts often overuse formal buzzwords
 — like 'innovative environment' or 'passionate team player' — without giving
 clear job duties."

## Geehan's Observations
>
> "Exactly. And fake posts? They're loaded with red flags.  
> Things like:  
>
> - Personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo)  
> - No company name  
> - Unrealistic salaries  
> - Typos and grammar issues
>
> Real jobs? They were specific. They mentioned actual tools, job titles, and had
 consistent tone.  
> One finding shocked us: Some AI-refined scams are cleaner than human-written posts."

## ⚠️ Why It Matters

***Speakers: Rouaa → Majd***

### Rouaa (1 min 30 sec)

> "This isn't just about spam — it's about safety.  
> Some scams ask you to pay for training. Others try to steal your info.  
> When AI is used to refine scams? It gets scarier. These posts are:
>
> - Faster to create  
> - Harder to detect  
> - More believable  
>  
> One click, and you could be giving out data you can't get back."
>
> "In one case we found, a fake ad asked applicants to send copies of their ID to
 'verify' their work-from-home eligibility.  
> That's basically handing over your identity.  
> The scary part? The post had:
>
> - Zero typos  
> - A perfect company logo  
> - A convincing LinkedIn profile  
>  
> This is why looking beyond surface polish is so important."

### Majd (1 min 20 sec)
>
> "You know, one of the key things our research found is that AI isn't just
helping us — it's also helping scammers scale up.  
> That means we all need to be more aware — whether you're:
>
> - A student  
> - Job seeker  
> - Platform owner  
>  
> It's not just about catching scams after they happen. It's about staying one
step ahead."
>
> "Just imagine this:  
> A scammer can now use AI to generate **a hundred polished, convincing job ads**
 in the time it used to take to write one.  
> That's why part of our focus is making it easier to spot red flags — we're talking:
>
> - Quick checks  
> - Student-friendly  
> - Takes <1 minute  
>  
> Because the faster we catch these scams, the harder it is for them to spread."

### Geehan: [30 seconds ]
>
> "And staying ahead means educating ourselves.  
> If we can train people to notice subtle patterns — like:  
>
> - Generic job descriptions  
> - Missing company info  
>  
> We make it harder for scams to succeed."

### ***Justina (inviting tone – 30 sec)***
>
> "The first phase of our study focused on linguistic features and machine
detection of fake jobs.  
> But humans are the ones that bear the consequences — and they've been
consistently left out in studies. We want to change that!  
> In our second phase, we're studying whether humans can spot the difference
between real, fake, and AI-generated jobs.  
> If you're a student or recent graduate, we'd love for you to take part."

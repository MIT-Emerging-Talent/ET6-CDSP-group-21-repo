> "Hey… can I tell you about something that happened to our friend MJ?  
> She’s a fresh graduate in data science.  
>
> One day, she got an email for what looked like the perfect job: junior data  
> science role, fully remote, decent pay.  
>
> At first glance, nothing seemed suspicious. But something… felt off."

### Justina - AI & Scams  

(1 min 10 sec)  

> "Scammers have always been around — but now they have AI on their side.  
> We’re talking about ads that look professional, read smoothly, and even use  
> technical terms like *data pipelines* or *predictive modeling* to sound  
> credible.  
>
> And yes… even MJ almost fell for one."

### Alaa - Red Flags  

(1 min)  

> "MJ noticed a few small red flags — a job description that was vague for  
> such a technical role, and requirements that felt too easy for the salary  
> offered.  
>
> But like a lot of fresh graduates, she didn’t want to lose a potential  
> opportunity.  
>
> Then came the request for an upfront payment during a so-called ‘trial  
> period.’ That’s when her instincts kicked in.  
>
> She dug deeper, checked the company’s registration, ran the ad through a  
> scam-detection tool — trust score: 56%.  
>
> She walked away. And just minutes later, she got a pushy phone call asking  
> her to pay for training immediately."

### Justina - Transition  

(40 sec)  

> "Ironically, MJ was part of our research project on detecting fake jobs —  
> and luckily, the findings from our research helped her spot the scam and  
> leave the role behind without proceeding with the application process.  
>
> So don’t worry about her." *(last part with a laughing tone)*  
>
> **OUR MAIN CONCERN IS YOU!**  
>
> You’ve now heard MJ’s story. We want to help you in the same way we helped  
> MJ. Let us walk you through what we did — and what we learned."

### Alaa - Findings  

(50 sec)  

> "We analyzed hundreds of job postings — real ones, human-written scams, and  
> AI-polished scams.  
>
> Here’s what we found:  
> • **AI-generated scams** love formal buzzwords like “innovative environment”  
> or “passionate team player,” but avoid specifics.  
> • **Human-written scams** are messier: typos, bad grammar, outrageous  
> salaries, personal email addresses.  
> • **Real jobs** name tools, list real responsibilities, and have a  
> consistent tone."

### Justina - The Danger  

(40 sec)  

> "One surprising finding? Some AI-refined scams are cleaner than real  
> postings — and that’s the danger.  
>
> We even found fake ads that asked for copies of ID to ‘verify’ work-from-  
> home eligibility. That’s basically handing over your identity."  

---

### Alaa - Tips  

(50 sec)  

> "So… what can you do?  
>
> 1️. Check the sender’s email — no Gmail or Yahoo for legit offers.  
> 2. Google the company and see what comes up.  
> 3. Be skeptical of ‘too good to be true’ salaries.  
> 4️. Watch for vague job descriptions and instant offers.  
> 5. And if something feels off — trust your gut."

### Justina - Invitation  

(45 sec)  

> "In phase one of our study, we focused on machine detection of fake jobs.  
>
> But humans are the ones who face the real risks — and they’ve been left out  
> of most studies.  
>
> We want to change that. In phase two, we’re testing if students can spot  
> real, fake, and AI-generated postings.  
>
> If you’re a student or recent grad, we’d love for you to join."

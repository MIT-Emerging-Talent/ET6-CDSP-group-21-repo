## ÔøΩ Script Content  

### üé§ Opening - Aseel (40 sec)  

"Hey... can I share something that happened to me?  
I saw this job ad that said 'no experience required, $5,000/week, work from home'.
It sounded awesome.  
But then the email came from... hiring123@gmail. That's when I knew something was
 wrong.

I'm Aseel, and you're listening to Scam Alert: Job Hunting in the Age of AI,  
brought to you by Hypatia Circle."

### üîç Investigation - Justina (1 min 10 sec)  

"Scammers have always existed ‚Äî but now, they've got AI on their side.  
We're talking about job posts written by ChatGPT. Posts that sound real. Look real.
Even feel professional. But they're not.  
As students ‚Äî especially new grads ‚Äî we're vulnerable..."

### üìä Analysis Findings - Alaa & Geehan (1 min 40 sec)  

#### Alaa's Analysis  

"We analyzed hundreds of job ads ‚Äî real, fake, and AI-refined ones.  
We looked at everything: word counts, punctuation, spammy phrases, and repetitive
 language.
Want to hear something weird? AI-generated posts often overuse formal buzzwords
 ‚Äî like 'innovative environment' or 'passionate team player' ‚Äî without giving
 clear job duties."

#### Geehan's Observations  

"Exactly. And fake posts? They're loaded with red flags.  
Things like:  

- Personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo)  
- No company name  
- Unrealistic salaries  
- Typos and grammar issues  

Real jobs? They were specific. They mentioned actual tools, job titles, and had
consistent tone.  
One finding shocked us: Some AI-refined scams are cleaner than human-written posts."

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Matters - Rouaa & Majd  

#### Rouaa (1 min 30 sec)  

"This isn't just about spam ‚Äî it's about safety.  
Some scams ask you to pay for training. Others try to steal your info.  
When AI is used to refine scams? It gets scarier. These posts are:  

- Faster to create  
- Harder to detect  
- More believable  

One click, and you could be giving out data you can't get back.  

In one case we found, a fake ad asked applicants to send copies of their ID to
'verify' their work-from-home eligibility.
That's basically handing over your identity.  
The scary part? The post had:  

- Zero typos  
- A perfect company logo  
- A convincing LinkedIn profile  

This is why looking beyond surface polish is so important."  

#### Majd (1 min 20 sec)  

"You know, one of the key things our research found is that AI isn't just helping
 us ‚Äî it's also helping scammers scale up.  
That means we all need to be more aware ‚Äî whether you're:  

- A student  
- Job seeker  
- Platform owner  

It's not just about catching scams after they happen. It's about staying one step
ahead.

Just imagine this:  
A scammer can now use AI to generate **a hundred polished, convincing job ads**
 in the time it used to take to write one.  
That's why part of our focus is making it easier to spot red flags ‚Äî we're talking:

- Quick checks  
- Student-friendly  
- Takes <1 minute  

Because the faster we catch these scams, the harder it is for them to spread."  

#### Geehan (30 sec)  

"And staying ahead means educating ourselves.  
If we can train people to notice subtle patterns ‚Äî like:  

- Generic job descriptions  
- Missing company info  

We make it harder for scams to succeed."  

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Checklist - Aseel (1 min)  

"So what can you do?  
Here's your quick checklist before applying:  

‚úÖ **Email Check**  
‚Ä£ No Gmail/Yahoo for legitimate offers  

‚úÖ **Company Verification**  
‚Ä£ Google the company (real jobs have websites & real people)  

‚úÖ **Salary Skepticism**  
‚Ä£ Be wary of 'too good to be true' offers  

‚úÖ **Job Description**  
‚Ä£ Watch for vagueness or instant offers  

üí° **Final Tip**  
‚Ä£ If something feels off ‚Äî trust your gut."  

### üéôÔ∏è Closing Remarks  

#### Justina (30 sec)  

"The first phase of our study focused on linguistic features and machine
detection of fake jobs.  
But humans are the ones that bear the consequences ‚Äî and they've been consistently
 left out in studies. We want to change that!  
In our second phase, we're studying whether humans can spot the difference between
 real, fake, and AI-generated jobs.  
If you're a student or recent graduate, we'd love for you to take part."

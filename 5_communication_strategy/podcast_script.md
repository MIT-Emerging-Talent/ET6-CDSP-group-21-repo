## Script Content

### Aseel - Opening

(spoken softly with a concerned tone – 30 sec)

> "Hey... can I share something that happened to me?  
> I saw this job ad that said ‘no experience required, $5,000/week, work from  
> home’. It sounded awesome.  
> But then the email came from… hiring123@gmail. That’s when I knew something  
> was wrong.  
> I’m Aseel, and you’re listening to *Scam Alert: Job Hunting in the Age of AI*,
> brought to you by Hypatia Circle."

### Justina - Investigation

(1 min 10 sec)

> "Scammers have always existed — but now, they’ve got AI on their side.  
> We’re talking about job posts written by ChatGPT. Posts that sound real. Look
> real. Even feel professional. But they’re not.  
> As students — especially new grads — we’re vulnerable. These scams promise  
> quick money, flexible hours, remote work… and zero experience.  
> So we asked: How do you tell the difference between a real job, a fake one…  
> and one generated by AI?
> > We decided to investigate."

### Alaa & Geehan - Analysis Findings

(1 min 40 sec)

#### Alaa'

> "We analyzed hundreds of job ads — real, fake, and AI-refined ones.  
> We looked at everything: word counts, punctuation, spammy phrases, and  
> repetitive language.  
> Want to hear something weird? AI-generated posts often overuse formal  
> buzzwords — like 'innovative environment' or 'passionate team player' —  
> without giving clear job duties."

#### Geehan

> "Exactly. And fake posts? They’re loaded with red flags:  
>
> - Personal emails (Gmail, Yahoo)  
> - No company name  
> - Unrealistic salaries  
> - Typos and grammar issues  
>
> Real jobs? They were specific. They mentioned actual tools, job titles, and  
> had a consistent tone.  
> One finding shocked us: Some AI-refined scams are cleaner than human-written  
> posts."

### Rouaa & Majd - Why It Matters

#### Rouaa

(1 min 30 sec)

> "This isn’t just about spam — it’s about safety.  
> Some scams ask you to pay for training. Others try to steal your info.  
> When AI is used to refine scams? It gets scarier. These posts are faster to  
> create, harder to detect, and more believable.  
> One click, and you could be giving out data you can’t get back."  
>
> "In one case we found, a fake ad asked applicants to send copies of their ID  
> to ‘verify’ their work-from-home eligibility. That’s basically handing over  
> your identity.  
> The scary part? The post had zero typos, a perfect company logo, and a  
> convincing LinkedIn profile linked to it.  
> This is why looking beyond surface polish is so important."

#### Majd

(1 min 20 sec)

> "You know, one of the key things our research found is that AI isn’t just  
> helping us — it’s also helping scammers scale up.  
> That means we all need to be more aware — whether you’re a
>
> - student
> - job seeker
> - platform
>
> It’s not just about catching scams after they  
> happen. It’s about staying one step ahead.  
>
> Just imagine this: a scammer can now use AI to generate a hundred polished,  
> convincing job ads in the time it used to take to write one.  
> That’s why part of our focus is making it easier to spot red flags — we’re  
> talking quick, student-friendly checks that take less than a minute.  
> Because the faster we catch these scams, the harder it is for them to spread."

> "And staying ahead means educating ourselves.  
> If we can train people to notice subtle patterns like
>
> - generic job descriptions
> - missing company info
>
> we make it harder for scams to succeed."

### Aseel - Safetly Checklist

(40 sec)

> "So what can you do?  
> Here’s your quick checklist before applying:  
>
> - Check the sender’s email — no Gmail or Yahoo for legit offers.  
> - Google the company — real jobs have websites and real people.  
> - Be skeptical of salaries that sound too good to be true.  
> - Watch out for vague job descriptions and instant offers.  
>
> And if something feels off — trust your gut."

(30 sec)

> "The first phase of our study focused on linguistic features and machine  
> detection of fake jobs.  
> But humans are the ones that bear the consequences — and they’ve been  
> consistently left out in studies. We want to change that!  
> In our second phase, we’re studying whether humans can spot the difference  
> between real, fake, and AI-generated jobs.  
> If you’re a student or recent graduate, we’d love for you to take part."

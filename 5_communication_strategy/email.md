# Protecting Students from Job Scams - Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Partner with Us to Protect Your Students from Job Scams

***Dear Career Services Team,***  

I'm Majd, and I'm part of the MIT Emerging Talent program 2024 - 2025. It's an
 online, one-year certificate program offered by MIT in Computer and Data Science.

Over the last three months, my team and I have focused on a critical issue: the
 rise of AI-generated job scams.

We've conducted in-depth research, analyzing thousands of real and fake job
 postings to understand the patterns and red flags. We've compiled our findings
  on this website [embed the link of the website]. We believe that our findings
   are essential for students and recent graduates who are navigating today's job
    market, as these individuals are the most likely targets for job scams, making
     them the most vulnerable category.

Why this matter? This issue matters deeply because scams are increasingly targeting
 students, often in subtle and deceptive ways. After hearing firsthand accounts
  from peers who lost money or personal data, we discovered that a staggering
   78% of scam victims don’t report their experiences due to embarrassment .
   Meanwhile, fake “remote work” postings have surged by 300% since 2022 , making
    platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, and others daily minefields for unsuspecting
     students. These alarming trends highlight the urgent need for awareness and
     proactive protection.
Through our website, students can access clear, research-backed guidance to help
 them spot red flags in job postings, recognize common scam tactics including
  AI-generated ones, and understand how to verify employer legitimacy. While we
   haven’t built a tool, we’ve analyzed the data and distilled practical advice
    to help students stay safe and informed.
Want to make a quick impact? Share our free resource with your department to help
 protect students from scams. You can find everything here: [[Websit Link](<https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-21-repo/tree/main/5_communication_strategy/website>)],
  and feel

Thank you for considering this partnership. Together, we can create a safer job
 market for emerging talent.  

Warm regards,

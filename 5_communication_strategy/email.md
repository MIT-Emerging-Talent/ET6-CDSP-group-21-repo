# Protecting Students from Job Scams - Outreach Email Template

**Subject:** Partner with Us to Protect Your Students from Job Scams  

***Cc***:[[Evan Email](evancole@mit.edu)]

***Dear Career Services Team,***  

I'm Majd, and I'm part of the MIT Emerging Talent program 2024 - 2025. It's an
 online, one-year certificate program offered by MIT in Computer and Data Science.

Over the last three months, my team and I have focused on a critical issue: the
 rise of AI-generated job scams.

We've conducted in-depth research, analyzing thousands of real and fake job
 postings to understand the patterns and red flags. **We've compiled our findings
  on this website**: [Our Website](https://detect-job-posts-intheageof-ai.netlify.app/)

Through our website, students can access clear, research-backed guidance to help
 them spot red flags in job postings, recognize common scam tactics including
 AI-generated ones, and understand how to verify employer legitimacy.
 While we haven’t built a tool, we’ve analyzed the data and distilled practical
  advice to help students stay safe and informed.

**As part of this work, we have also built a live application as part of a human
 study to understand how individuals detect these fraudulent postings**. This
  interactive platform is a crucial component of our research, designed to gather
   real-time human insights to complement our findings. We are specifically
    recruiting students and recent graduates to participate, and we would be grateful
     if you could help us share this opportunity. Your students can access the study
      and contribute to this important work here: [Job Board Human Study App](https://job-board-app-phi.vercel.app/)

**Why this matters?** This issue matters deeply because scams are increasingly
 targeting students, often in subtle and deceptive ways. After hearing firsthand
  accounts from peers who lost money or personal data, we discovered that a
  staggering 78% of scam victims don’t report their experiences due to embarrassment.
  Meanwhile, fake “remote work” postings have surged by 300% since 2022, making
   platforms like LinkedIn, Handshake, and others daily minefields for unsuspecting
    students. These alarming trends highlight the urgent need for awareness and
     proactive protection.

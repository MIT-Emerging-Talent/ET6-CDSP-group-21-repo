# Communication Strategy for Job Posting Project

Welcome to the **Communication Strategy** documentation for our project on
distinguishing between real, fake, and AI-generated job postings. This guide
outlines our approach to reaching target audiences and effectively delivering
our findings.

---

## 1. Target Audience

Our main audience segments are **students who are looking for jobs**,
 especially **university students or recent graduates**.

**Constraints & Capabilities:**  

- **Constraints:** Limited job market experience, may lack awareness of job scam
   tactics, often eager and in a hurry to secure opportunities.  
- **Capabilities:** Active online, tech-savvy, open to learning from digital
   media like podcasts, videos, and interactive content.  

**How to reach them:**  

- Through the [**website**](https://detect-job-posts-intheageof-ai.netlify.app/)
which we built as a way to communicate our findings. It hosts textual
information, podcast, and visual results (such as graphs).
- Sharing the website link via student networks, social media, and possibly university
career centers (LinkedIn).

**What they should learn:**  

- How to identify job scams and avoid them.  
- Common red flags in job postings.  
- How AI is involved in creating sophisticated scams.  

**What they should do:**  

- Apply critical thinking when reviewing job offers.  
- Use provided tools/checklists to evaluate job ads.  
- Share this knowledge with peers.  

**How we hope theyâ€™d interact:** *(not fully in our control, but our goal)*  

- Engage with the website by listening to the podcast and watching the videos.  
- Explore the graphs and data to understand the scope of the problem.  
- Share the resources on social media or within their university circles.

## 2. Artefacts

We propose creating practical assets to support our strategy:  

- **Podcast & Storytelling:** Share a narrative of a job seeker encountering fake
   postings.  
- **Platform Integration:** Centralize all communication artefacts for easy access.

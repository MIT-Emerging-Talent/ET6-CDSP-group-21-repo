# 📢 Communication Strategy for Job Posting Project

Welcome to the **Communication Strategy** documentation for our project on
distinguishing between real, fake, and AI-generated job postings. This guide
outlines our approach to reaching target audiences and effectively delivering
our findings.

Our main audience segments are:

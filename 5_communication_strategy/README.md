# 📢 Communication Strategy for Job Posting Project

Welcome to the **Communication Strategy** documentation for our project on
distinguishing between real, fake, and AI-generated job postings. This guide
outlines our approach to reaching target audiences and effectively delivering
our findings.

## 🎯 1. Target Audience

Our main audience segments are **students who are looking for jobs**,
 especially **university students or recent graduates**.

**Constraints & Capabilities:**  

- **Constraints:** Limited job market experience, may lack awareness of job scam
   tactics, often eager and in a hurry to secure opportunities.  
- **Capabilities:** Active online, tech-savvy, open to learning from digital
   media like podcasts, videos, and interactive content.  

**How to reach them:**  

- Through a dedicated **website** that hosts the podcast, videos, and visual
   results (such as graphs).
- Sharing links via student networks, social media, and possibly university
   career centers (LinkedIn).

**What they should learn:**  

- How to identify job scams and avoid them.  
- Common red flags in job postings.  
- How AI is involved in creating sophisticated scams.  

**What they should do:**  

- Apply critical thinking when reviewing job offers.  
- Use provided tools/checklists to evaluate job ads.  
- Share this knowledge with peers.  

**How we hope they’d interact:** *(not fully in our control, but our goal)*  

- Engage with the website by listening to the podcast and watching the videos.  
- Explore the graphs and data to understand the scope of the problem.  
- Share the resources on social media or within their university circles.

## 🛠 2. Artefacts

We propose creating practical assets to support our strategy:  

- **Podcast & Storytelling:** Share a narrative of a job seeker encountering fake
   postings.  
- **Comic Book:** Visual storytelling highlighting common job scam scenarios.  
- **Platform Integration:** Centralize all communication artefacts for easy access.

## ✨ 4. Design & Engagement Tactics

- **Interactive elements:** polls, quizzes, “spot the fake job” challenges  
- **Visual cues:** emojis, icons, subtle animations in Markdown (`:sparkles:`)  
- **Highlight key info:** use bold and callouts for important points  

## 🔗 5. Implementation Notes

1. Start by creating templates for LinkedIn posts and website visuals with clear
    hierarchy.
2. Set up Google Form for user reporting and integrate results on platform dashboard.
3. Produce short podcast episodes with voice echo and narrative storytelling.  
4. Develop the Comic Book and host it on the website.  
5. Regularly update README with any new strategies or tools introduced.

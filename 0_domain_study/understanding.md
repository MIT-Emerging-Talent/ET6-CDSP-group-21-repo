# Understanding the Problem Domain

## Exploring Remote Job Scams (2015â€“2025)

---

## ðŸ§©The Problem at a Glance

Over the past decade, remote work has become a major part of the job
market. At the same time, scammers have become more sophisticatedâ€”using
AI-generated language to post fake jobs that look real.

Job seekers, especially students and early-career professionals, are often
the targets. Unfortunately, many existing fraud detection tools still rely on
surface-level clues like grammar or spelling errors, which AI can now
easily avoid.

Our group sees this as more than just a technical challenge. Itâ€™s a
system-wide problem that involves people, technology, platforms, and trust.

|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Job Seekers                   | More remote work opportunities             |
| Scammers                      | Use of AI to generate realistic listings   |

> Navigating the problem through events → patterns → structures → beliefs

## Event  

Scam job postings are rising—often indistinguishable from real ones.  
People apply, share personal data, and even send payments—only to realize  
they’ve been tricked.

---

## Patterns and Trends  

**Common tactics:**  

- Upfront payment requests (e.g., background check, training, equipment)  
- Psychological pressure (urgency, no interviews, fake company names)  
- Use of real employee names from LinkedIn or company pages  

**Most impacted groups:**  

- Age group TBD  
- Young professionals, job seekers under financial stress  

**Growth over time:**  

- Action Fraud UK received 4,876 scam job reports in 2024  
  vs 2,094 in 2022 ([BBC source](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68646460))

## structures Behind the Pattern  

- The job application process—legit or fake—follows a predictable script.  
- People expect to provide personal info and don’t question the steps.  
- Scammers exploit this trusted structure, mimicking real HR processes.

---

## Mental Models Keeping the System in Place  

- **Desperation mindset:** “I need a job, I’ll try anything.”  
- **Shame barrier:** Victims rarely speak up or warn others.  
- **Individual blame:** The system treats this as a personal mistake,  
  not a systemic failure.  
- **Normalization of risk:** “Scams are common—it’s just how things are now.”

## What Stakeholders Are Doing  

- **LinkedIn:** Claims 99.3% of spam/scams are blocked by AI.  
- **New detection tools:** Deep learning models that flag AI-generated  
  images or repeated structures in text.

## Gaps We Aim to Explore  

- Can LLM-generated scams be flagged through better linguistic cues?  
- What happens when humans see a scam score before applying?  
- Are existing detection tools still relevant in the age of generative AI?

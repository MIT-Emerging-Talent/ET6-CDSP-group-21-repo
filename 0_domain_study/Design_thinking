- Applies for the job  
- Stays somewhat aware of scams

## 💔 What the User Feels  

- Excited and hopeful at first  
- Then shocked, anxious, panicked, and discouraged  
- May feel ashamed or embarrassed and choose to stay silent

excited by offers from “legit” companies—only to realize  
they were scams mimicking trusted brands.

# Design Thinking: The Job Seeker's Experience

> Navigating the problem through a user-centered lens

---

## What the User Says  
>
> “What would I lose? I’ll apply and see how this goes!”

## What the User Thinks  
>
> “Can’t help it but set high hopes!”

## What the User Does  

- Applies for the job  
- Stays somewhat aware of scams  
- May report the posting—if they realize it’s fake  

## What the User Feels  

- Excited and hopeful at first  
- Then shocked, anxious, panicked, and discouraged  
- May feel ashamed or embarrassed and choose to stay silent  

Example:  
Two case studies from the UK showed real applicants who were  
excited by offers from “legit” companies—only to realize  
they were scams mimicking trusted brands.

# Domain Study: The New Era of Scam Detection ![Icon](https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/128/10352/10352961.png)

Welcome to our **Milestone 1** research folder for the CDSP project ðŸš€  
This is where we begin our deep dive into a growing problem:

> **To what extent can job seekers and existing classifier models accurately  
> detect fraudulent job postings crafted by advanced AI, and how do automated  
> scam scores influence job seeker engagement with identified risks?**

---

The job market is flooded with fake postings and AI is making them harder.
We're studying how this impacts both human decision-making and scam detection tools.

We focus on:

- Human behavior (trust, urgency, cognitive bias)  
- Cybersecurity (fraud signals and red flags)  
- NLP systems (classifiers vs LLM-generated scam text)

## Why This Study Matters

Despite better filters and user alerts, job scams are rising fast.

- Reported U.S. losses hit **$750.6M in 2024**, up $250M from 2023
- Scam reports tripled from 2020â€“2024  
  ([FTC Source](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2024/01/job-scams-cost-consumers-millions))

These numbers raise a key concern:

> Are AI-written scams so polished that even machines and trained users  
> can no longer spot them?

If yes, we may need to rethink detection from the ground up.

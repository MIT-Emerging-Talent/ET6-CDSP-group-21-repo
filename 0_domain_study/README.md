## Understanding the Problem Domain  

### ðŸ§© The Problem at a Glance

In recent years, remote work has become a major part of the job marketâ€”but
alongside it, job scams have surged. With the rise of **AI-generated text**,
scammers now craft **convincing fraudulent job postings** that easily bypass
traditional red flags like grammar errors or formatting issues.

This has created a **trust crisis**, particularly for students and early-career
professionals navigating digital job platforms. Existing fraud detection
methodsâ€”many of which rely solely on **linguistic analysis**â€”are no longer
enough. Our group sees this not just as a technical issue, but as a
**systemic problem** that spans platforms, tools, and user vulnerability.

### Applying Systems Thinking

We looked at the different parts of this system and how they interact.

|   **Actors**         |   **Evolving Dynamics**                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Job Seekers           | Increased exposure to remote listings and online fraud|
| Scammers              | Using AI tools to produce highly realistic fake jobs  |
| Job Platforms         | Struggling to verify postings at scale                |
| Security Experts      | Exploring smarter fraud detection techniques          |
| Machine Learning Tools| Used for both scam creation and detection             |

### Why It Matters

If these scams continue to grow unchecked:

- Platforms may **lose user trust**
- Vulnerable populations may **face emotional and financial harm**
- **AI advancements** may be weaponized by bad actors faster than they are
  countered

### Our Approach

This project aims to address these challenges through a
**machine learningâ€“driven fraud detection model** focused on **text-based
indicators**. Additionally, we explore the potential for incorporating
**technical fraud markers** (like suspicious form behaviors and tracking
patterns) to build a **hybrid detection system**.

By analyzing job scams between **2015â€“2025**, our group seeks to:

- Understand how fraud tactics evolved in the **AI era**
- Evaluate whether current detection strategies are sufficient
- Offer a framework that combines **linguistic features** and **platform
  behaviors**

# Background Review: What Came Before

Understanding the evolution of scam detection—before and after the rise of AI.

## Pre-AI Era: Traditional Detection

Before the emergence of large language models (LLMs), scam detection efforts
depended on a combination of manual review, awareness campaigns, and rule-based
machine learning techniques. These models typically relied on the assumption
that scam content deviated significantly from legitimate postings.

Common features used for detection included:

- Grammar and spelling errors
- Urgent or manipulative language
- Suspicious email addresses or web domains
- Requests for payment or sensitive personal information

Job platforms and security researchers focused on building models around these
surface-level signals.

## The Impact of LLMs on Scam Generation

LLMs, such as GPT-based models, have made it possible to generate job postings
that closely resemble real advertisements in tone, formatting, and content.
This introduces new challenges for existing detection systems:

- Scams can now replicate brand language and corporate tone
- Generated text is often grammatically perfect and logically structured
- AI can produce a high volume of scam variations at scale

These developments threaten the foundations of traditional scam detection
systems.

## Current Detection Tools and Methods

Modern job platforms have integrated more advanced detection tools, including
deep learning and behavioral analysis:

- LinkedIn uses neural networks to identify fake accounts and spam behavior
- Profile images are analyzed for AI-generated signs using pattern recognition
- Duplicate postings and high-frequency content are flagged by backend systems
- Browser extensions and reputation tools flag suspicious URLs, but rarely
  analyze the job text itself

Despite these advances, most tools focus on user identity and platform behavior
rather than textual content alone.

## Limitations in Existing Research and Systems

There are key limitations in both current detection systems and the literature:

- Existing models are not trained on LLM-generated scam content
- Human reviewers often fail to detect well-written fraudulent text
- Detection efforts often rely on post-event reporting by victims
- Scams that span multiple platforms or regions remain poorly addressed
- Most research focuses on English-language or Western contexts

These gaps highlight the need for updated datasets, features, and evaluation
criteria that reflect the evolving nature of scam content.

## Our Study’s Contribution

Our work aims to assess whether current classifiers—and human readers—can
distinguish between legitimate jobs, real scams, and LLM-generated fraud.
To do so, we will:

- Generate realistic scam postings using LLMs
- Compare linguistic and structural patterns across real and generated samples
- Evaluate detection performance by both models and human participants
- Identify features that may improve detection going forward

This study lays the groundwork for designing more resilient and adaptive
scam detection systems.

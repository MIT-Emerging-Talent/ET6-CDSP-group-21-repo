# Our Group Learning Goals

As a capable and committed team working on our group project, we aim to grow together—not just as individuals, but as collaborators. These are the learning goals we’ve set for ourselves as we prepare to build a meaningful and impactful project:

## 1. Improve Team Collaboration

- Communicate clearly, respectfully, and consistently  
- Support each other through feedback, code reviews, and shared learning  
- Stay organized and aligned on goals, responsibilities, and progress  

## 2. Build the Skills Our Project Will Need

- Strengthen our technical foundation in Python, data manipulation, and statistics  
- Stay open to learning new tools or libraries based on the needs of the project  
- Focus on writing clear, modular code that can adapt as our project evolves  
- Collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub to avoid conflicts and keep our codebase organized  

## 3. Work in a Flexible and Reflective Way

- Break our work into small, manageable steps and focus on steady progress  
- Meet regularly to share updates, give feedback, and adjust plans if needed  
- Learn from challenges as we go, rather than waiting until the end  
- Stay open to new ideas and changes, even if the original plan shifts  

## 4. Focus on Meaningful Impact

- Keep real-world problems and ethical thinking at the center of our work  
- Build solutions that are reliable, interpretable, and useful  
- Prioritize clarity, quality, and thoughtful outcomes in everything we create  

## 5. Grow Together

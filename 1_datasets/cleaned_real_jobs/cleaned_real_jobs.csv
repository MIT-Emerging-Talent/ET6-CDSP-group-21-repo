Salary: $31.36 - $37.95 per hour


Welcome to Miaplaza!

Our vision is to elevate online learning by applying the most successful approaches in virtual education to create an accessible and inclusive homeschool curriculum platform where all students can be successful!


MiaPrep Online High School (MOHS) is our online high school for students grades 7-12. Formed in 2022 and accredited in 2023, we’ve grown from 80 students our first year to over 530 in 2025! Miaplaza’s leadership aims to continue this high-growth trajectory, with a goal of serving 10,000+ students in the next 5-10 years! 🚀


We’re seeking a passionate and resourceful High School Math Teacher to join our team. This is a fully remote, asynchronous teaching role that emphasizes student support, feedback, and mentorship rather than live instruction. Teachers at MOHS do not create lesson plans or deliver live classes; instead, they guide students through our self-paced curriculum on MiaPrep.com, providing coaching, small-group tutoring, and in-depth feedback on summative assignments. In addition to their teaching responsibilities, all MOHS teachers also serve as Academic Advisors to a caseload of up to 30 students, building relationships and helping students meet their goals.

Academic Advising: Maintain a caseload of students for whom you will provide academic advising, including quarterly check-ins, and in some cases, targeted support plans.
Tiered Support: Identify struggling students and, together with the Student Support Specialist and Academic Counselors, proactively provide tiered support solutions to enhance their academic performance.
Parental and Student Communication: Act as the primary point of contact for both parents and students in academic matters in your subject area, ensuring a constructive channel of communication.
School Community Engagement: Actively participate in school initiatives and contribute to the creation and implementation of school-wide academic policies. Lead or contribute to an extracurricular club or activity that aligns with your expertise or passion.
Positive Culture Building: Uphold and contribute to our school's positive culture and values, both among the faculty and the student body.
Ownership: Be willing to speak up when things can be improved, and willing to step up when a need is identified or support is needed within the school community.


Schedule

MOHS Teachers are expected to have 40 hours of availability each week on a year-round basis.
Availability during school hours, Monday through Friday between 8 am and 4 pm in a U.S. timezone (ET, CT, MT, or PT) is required to hold office hours, student meetings, and other school activities.

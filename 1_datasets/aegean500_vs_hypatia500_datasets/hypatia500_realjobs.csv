Location: Preferably Houston Area 
Territory: Texas 
Status: Full-time, Permanent (1) 

 We’re not looking for just another chemicals Account Manager. We are looking for a technical, refinery-savvy, in-person closer who thrives in a fast-paced, boots-on-the-ground sales environment, who enjoys meeting new potential customers. 

 If you know your way around a refinery, enjoy walking units with engineers, and have the grit to chase down new business while building long-term trust with commercial and technical stakeholders, we want to hear from you. 

 At Quadra, we’re expanding, and looking for a Technical Account Manager to take charge of a key territory in Texas. 

 This isn’t a desk job or a slow-burn sales cycle. You’ll be face-to-face with decision makers across refining, LNG and petrochemical plants, owning your territory as an entrepreneur and representing one of the most respected chemical distributors in North America. 

 You’ll report directly to the Sales Manager, who will expect you to lead with initiative, building relationships, identifying pain points, and capturing value at each customer location, from engineers and operators to procurement teams.

 An individual who can seamlessly take over existing business and leverage those relationships to grow Quadra’s footprint with strategic customers.
 A technical engineer with a firm grasp of refining operations.
 A visible, in-person presence, on the road, in plants, face-to-face with customers. After a year, your customers should know your name, Quadra and champion the value you bring.
 A team player who values transparency and collaboration, leveraging Salesforce to track Accounts, share Insights, manage Opportunity and contribute to a culture of accountability and territory growth.
 Someone who fits our people-first, entrepreneurial culture and is in it for the long haul.

  In-Person
  Anticipated deadline to submit application: Aug 1, 5pm ET. Position may close early if application limit is met. Apply promptly for full consideration.
  The Opportunity
 CEO is currently seeking to hire a Job Developer for our local office, a role that's crucial to CEO's work to help individuals coming out of incarceration regain the skills and confidence needed for a successful transition to stable and productive lives.
 Job Developers increase the range of employment opportunities available to our participants using participant interests, experiences, and their ambitions as foundation for participant job placements, and more broadly, for the identification and cultivation of potential employers for prospect portfolios.
 The most rewarding part of being an Job Developer is the joy you feel upon making the ""right fit"" match between participant and employer. Your expertise and insight lead not only to successful matches in the now, but to participant longevity in the workforce which often drastically reduces the rate of recidivism.
 As part of our mission, we strongly encourage individuals who have lived experience of incarceration or involvement in the justice system to apply for this role.
  Who We Are
 The Center for Employment Opportunities (CEO) provides employment services to people recently released from incarceration. Across the United States, 8,000-9,000 people participate in CEO each year, transitioning to employment that supports themselves, their families, and their communities.
 What began as a demonstration project of the Vera Institute of Justice in the 1970s to address employment barriers facing the formerly incarcerated following release in New York City has grown into the leading reentry employment organization in the country, where over 30,000 formerly incarcerated individuals have secured full-time employment since 1996.
  Who You Are
 
  You're deeply dedicated to social justice and perhaps are already working in the re-entry space
  You come to CEO with experience in workforce development, recruitment, or sales/account management, a role in which you needed to meet performance goals on a regular basis
  You're passionate about making an impact in people's lives and interested in guiding them to achieve their career goals through a balance of accountability and empathy
  You enjoy networking and cultivating lasting relationships with people and businesses, helping them understand how our work can help them achieve their business strategy and goals
  You have excellent interpersonal and written communication skills with the ability to adjust to particular personalities and interaction styles on the spot
  You're resilient and never give up, anticipating and addressing challenges along the way while keeping your eye on the end goal
  You're comfortable working under pressure and meeting deadlines despite opposition or setbacks
  You're able to look at a set of data or market research and use it to guide your practice and decision-making
 
 Responsibilities
 Key responsibilities of the Job Developer include but are not limited to:
  Business Strategy and Analysis
 
  Envision, develop, and implement a strategic plan for placement services that ensures CEO meets its participant placement metrics
  Conduct reviews of existing CEO business partnerships regularly, evaluate employer demand and usage of CEO services, and determine improvements and ways to leverage relationships with employers
  Achieve weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual placement goals in accordance with CEO's contractual obligations
 
 Relationship Cultivation and Maintenance
 
  Research, conduct outreach to, and build relationships with prospective employers willing to hire CEO participants and who have hiring needs that match the skills, experience, and interests of our overall participant cohort
  Maintain relationships with existing employer partners
  Schedule and conduct daily prospecting, cold calls, and face-to-face meetings
  Serve as the liaison among employers, participants, and our criminal justice partners
 
 Job Placement
 
  You are expected to produce up to 5 direct placements a month
  Screen and match program participants with employment opportunities, taking into consideration each participant's skills, work experience, interests, and goals and aspirations
  Customize participants' resumes to fit identified opportunities
  Manage a caseload of participants, support and coach them around applying for jobs, navigating the hiring process, and finding and securing right fit employment
 
 Administrative Support
 
  Document all participant and employer contact, activities, and outcomes in our case management system (Salesforce)
  Perform other job-related duties and responsibilities assigned from time to time
 
 Compensation and Benefits
 The salary for this position is $47,250. In an effort to be both equitable and transparent, CEO's compensation philosophy considers a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, experience, internal equity, and home office location in making a final determination on our salary offer.
 We recognize that salary is a part of the overall compensation package and also provide a comprehensive benefits package, including medical and dental coverage, as well as professional development opportunities and training, including regular training opportunities in Motivational Interviewing (MI). MI is one evidence-based skill that reentry and human service professionals can utilize when supporting participants to achieve their goals.
 We also offer paid parental leave, participation in a retirement plan, sick and vacation leave, paid holidays and more. We are a workplace that promotes continual learning and teamwork, offering lunch and learns, team outings, holiday gatherings and more for our staff.
  More About Us
 Center for Employment Opportunities believes that everyone deserves the chance to shape a stronger future for themselves, their families, and their communities. People who are justice involved are highly encouraged to apply for vacant positions at all levels. CEO is committed to the CROWN Act, and creating an open space where our employees can present as their true authentic selves.

Framework/CMS familiarity: Experience with CSS frameworks or component libraries (e.g. Bootstrap, Tailwind) and understanding of front-end frameworks (e.g. the basics of React, Vue, or similar) for potential future use. Comfortable working within a CMS – HubSpot CMS experience is a big plus.
Eye for detail & UX principles: Strong understanding of typography, color, and layout. Familiarity with usability principles and accessibility standards (WCAG). You strive to make interfaces intuitive for end-users.

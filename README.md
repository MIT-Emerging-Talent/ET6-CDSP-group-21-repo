# Problem Statement

On 6/12/2025, a group of about 100 students from the MIT Emerging Talent Program attended a job readiness workshop with program staff, Carlos. One problem quickly stood out: almost every student present had encountered a fake job posting.

[The Hypatia Circle](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-21-repo/blob/main/collaboration/README.md) converged after the meeting to discuss and scope a project based on this.

**Problem Statement: Detecting Fraudulent Remote Job Postings In the AI Era: A Machine Learning Approach**

As AI-generated text becomes more sophisticated, scammers can craft **convincing fake job postings**, making traditional fraud detection methods, largely reliant on linguistic analysis, less effective. Remote job scams are particularly concerning, as they **lack physical verification mechanisms**, making deception easier to execute.  

This project explores a **groundbreaking hybrid approach**; integrating **text-based analysis with technical fraud markers**, such as **website behavior, tracking elements, and form submission patterns**, to develop a more holistic scam detection framework. By analyzing **job postings from 2015-2025**, we aim to assess **how fraud tactics have evolved pre- and post-AI advancements** and whether purely text-based classifiers remain sufficient.  

While the **primary focus is text-based classification**, this study will **consult experts** on the feasibility of incorporating **non-text indicators** into scam detection. Should technical fraud markers prove difficult to track due to data constraints, the project will **refine its scope to focus solely on linguistic fraud detection** while keeping non-text analysis open for future research.

### **Scope:**  
**Core Focus:** Text-based scam detection using machine learning models.  
**Exploratory Area:** Investigating non-text indicators (website behavior, tracking patterns, form submissions) with expert consultation.  
**Dataset Strategy:** Since no structured dataset exists for 2015-2025, we will **scrape and curate our own dataset** from verified job postings.  
**Comparative Analysis:** Fraud evolution pre- vs. post-AI advancements.  

### **Objectives:**  
- **Develop a machine learning model** to classify scam vs. legitimate remote job listings.  
- **Analyze linguistic fraud patterns**, focusing on deceptive phrasing and urgency indicators.  
- **Assess feasibility** of non-text-based fraud markers and their integration into detection models.  
- **Evaluate the impact** of AI-generated text on scam effectiveness.  

### **Expected Outcomes:**  
* A fraud detection model that **prioritizes text analysis**, with potential expansion into technical fraud markers.  
* A **structured dataset** capturing 2015-2025 scam trends in remote job postings.  
* Insights into **how scammers have adapted** as AI tools improve text generation.  
* Expert consultation to determine whether non-text indicators can enhance scam detection.
